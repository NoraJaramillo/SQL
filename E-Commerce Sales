##This dataset downloaded from Kaggle, contains transaction details from an e-commerce business.
It includes sales, product, and purchase date information, making it useful for analyzing sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

The data spans from December 2010 to December 2011, so for practical purposes, the analysis is conducted as if it were January 1, 2012. 
This approach allows us to simulate real-world decision-making based on the latest available data.

This dataset will be used for data visualization in Tableau, where key insights on sales performance, customer segmentation, and product trends will be presented through interactive dashboards.

SELECT 
  customerid, MAX(DATE '2012-01-01' - DATE(invoicedate)) AS Recency, COUNT(invoiceno) as Frequency, SUM(unitprice*quantity) as Monetary
FROM 
  sales_data
  GROUP BY customerid
